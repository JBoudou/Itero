  <h3>Why iterative voting ?</h3>
  <p>
    Most common voting systems, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority#Majority_vote">majority</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)">plurality</a>, have been proved by scientists
    to have some important limitations. In particular, these voting systems encourage
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting">strategic voting</a>: voters usually first guess which
    alternatives are likely to win and limit their vote to these possible winners. This may results in outcomes in
    contradiction with the sincere preferences of the voters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iterative voting proposes to mitigate the impact of strategic voting by voting multiple times.
    On the first rounds, voters can vote for their prefered alternative wihout the risk of loosing their vote,
    because they know they could change their vote later on.
    Then, voters may change their vote to an alternative with more chances to win.
    This decision is not based on a guess, as in non-iterative votes, but on the results of the previous rounds of vote.
